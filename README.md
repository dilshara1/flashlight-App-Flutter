# flashlight

A new Flutter project.

## Getting Started

This project is a starting point for a Flutter application.



The Flashlight app is a simple mobile application that allows users to turn on and off their device's flashlight. With just a tap on the screen, the user can switch between the flashlight being on or off. The app's interface consists of a gradient background and an icon representing the flashlight that changes color depending on its status. The app is straightforward and easy to use, making it a handy tool for situations where a quick source of light is needed.
